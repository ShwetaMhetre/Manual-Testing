 **Project Title:** Enhancing OpenCart's Performance with Comprehensive Manual Testing

Key Features:

1. Test Cases: The repository includes a well-defined set of test cases covering various aspects of OpenCart, including user registration, product management, order processing, payment gateways, and administrative functions. Test cases are categorized by module and user role for easy navigation and execution.

2. Test Scenarios: Detailed test scenarios provide step-by-step instructions for replicating specific user journeys and interactions within the OpenCart platform. This facilitates consistent and efficient testing across different testers and ensures thorough coverage of key functionalities.

3. Expected Results: Every test case clearly defines expected results for each interaction. This helps testers identify bugs, regressions, and inconsistencies in OpenCart's behavior.

4. Reporting: The project encourages testers to document their findings using a standardized template. This includes logging bugs, screenshots, and detailed descriptions of encountered issues.

This project demonstrates proficiency in manual testing methodologies, including the creation of comprehensive test cases, thorough test scenario coverage, meticulous tracking of expected results, and detailed bug reporting. It showcases the ability to ensure the quality and reliability of software applications through systematic testing procedures and effective communication of identified issues.
